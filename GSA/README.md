# Quantifying the Uncertainty and Global Sensitivity of Quantum Computations on Experimental Hardware

This repository provides the implementation of Global Sensitivity Analysis approach utilized in our manuscript "Quantifying the Uncertainty and Global Sensitivity of Quantum Computations on Experimental Hardware" by Guanglei Xu, Kalpana Hanthanan Arachchilage, M.Y. Hussaini, and William S. Oates. 

This code (SICalc_dependent_complete.m) estimates first, second and total order sensitivity indices for cases with dependent variables. Originally based on the paper titled "estimation of global sensitivity indices for models with dependent variables" by Kucherenko 2012.

code starts with loading parameter correlations (i.e., stat.mat) that has the mean vector (mu) and covariance matrix (sigma).
