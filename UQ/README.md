# Quantifying the Uncertainty and Global Sensitivity of Quantum Computations on Experimental Hardware

This repository provides the implementation of Global Sensitivity Analysis approach utilized in our manuscript "Quantifying the Uncertainty and Global Sensitivity of Quantum Computations on Experimental Hardware" by Guanglei Xu, Kalpana Hanthanan Arachchilage, M.Y. Hussaini, and William S. Oates. 

This folder consists of the Matlab files used in uncertainty quantification analysis presented in the abovementioned paper.

## main.m file
This is the executable file. 

## getModelResponse*.m files
These files estimate the quantum probabilities used for function evaluations. 

## getModelResponseError*.m files
These files estimate the errors corresponding to the measurement and the model response.
